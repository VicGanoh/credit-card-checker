# Credit_Card_Checker
This is a console-based application written in Javascript to check if a credit card is valid or not using Luhn Algorithm.<br/>
There are 15 arrays that each contain the digits of separate credit card numbers. They all have prefixes to reflect their status, i.e. variables that start with "valid" contain a valid number, whereas "invalid" do not, and "mystery" variables can be either. There is also a "batch" array that stores all of the provided credit cards in a single array.<br/>
These arrays later check if the functions are working properly.
